This is version 2.0 of the Pokedex that I made a long time ago.
I was lack of experience at that time, so the old version was kind of... messy, with lots of redudant code.

Since then, I have studied and practiced a lot to improve my skills. So I thought I could redo it. 

In this version, although the design is similar, the code base is totally different.
For example:
- Use SCSS instead of plain old CSS. 
- Async/Await instead of Promise.
- axios instead of fetch().
- Follow Functional Programming concept.
- New Voice Feature using ResponsiveVoice JS.
...

Well, I know it could be improved more here and there. But it's still... something!
Hope you like it!
